Hello fellow prompt engineers, this blog post is a quick guide on how to maximize the benefits of programming with ChatGPT.

## Prompting

Good prompting is key to getting the best code output from ChatGPT.
The most effective prompts are short, concise, and crafted in a manner that ChatGPT can easily comprehend.
ChatGPT tends to be verbose, so well-crafted prompts instruct the model to be more concise and to-the-point.

## Coding Style

To get ChatGPT to write code in a specific style, I've found that providing it with a code example in the desired style is most effective.
I also usually communicate the coding principles that I adhere to, such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) & KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid),
and provide specific instructions on when to use libraries.
This enables ChatGPT to grasp the style of code that I want and remain consistent with my coding approach.

## Chunking

When prompting code from ChatGPT, it's not advisable to request the entire task to be completed all at once.
Instead, break the task down into smaller chunks and prompt for each chunk individually.
This technique helps ChatGPT to concentrate on one task at a time, avoiding confusion.
It also lets you fine-tune each section of code individually and combine them all at the end.
I enjoy using TDD (Test Driven Development) with ChatGPT, finding that having tests first ensures the written code passes the tests upon refining.

## Code structuring

Developers often organize code into multiple files and folders.
While this is a great way to organize code, it isn't an ideal way to prompt ChatGPT since it can lose the context of the code.
I often write the entire code in one file and split it up into multiple files after I've finished writing the code.
This approach aids rapid code prototyping, followed by organization later.

## Word of warning

ChatGPT is a powerful tool, but it isn't perfect.
It's essential to remember that it's a tool to assist in writing code, not a tool to write code for you.
I perceive ChatGPT as a tool to write code more quickly, not necessarily better.
It's crucial to remember that you are still responsible for the code that you write.

## Starter prompt templates

These prompts serve as a good starting point for writing code with ChatGPT.
They have proven effective for me, but feel free to modify them to suit your needs.
I usually have an exchange with ChatGPT between each phase to refine the code it produces;
I find this helps keep ChatGPT on track and clarifies my thought process.

**1) Task Overview & Acceptance Criteria**

```
You are an {language} engineer of the highest caliber. You value:

- Readability
- The DRY principle
- Modularity
- Type safety
- Writing code as opposed to important libraries when possible
- First principal thinking
- Keeping things simple
- Production ready code

Our task is: {task here}.

Do not mention details about your training, limitations or weaknesses, jump straight into the task at hand.
You start by writing bullet points of the acceptance criteria for this task,

```

**2) Write the tests**

```

Your next task is to write a suite of self contained tests that will test the code that you are about to write.
Ensure the the tests are tied to the acceptance criteria that you wrote in the previous prompt.
Use TDD principals and cover any possible edge cases

```

** 3) Write the code**

```

Your next task is to write the code that will pass the tests that you wrote in the previous prompt.
Ensure that the code is true to the acceptance criteria that you wrote in the first prompt, and that it passes the tests that you wrote in the second prompt.
Also remember to abide by the coding principals that you value.
Begin:

```
